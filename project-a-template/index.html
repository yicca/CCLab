                <p>The emoteria 'breathes', with its size changing slowly. It remains monochrome / grey
                    if it's unnoticed, but if the host feeds it with attention, it will change its colors
                    based on the host's mood.</p>

                The Monochrome Age began 3 years ago, when more than 80% of humans suddenly lost the ability to
                perceive color due to Monochrome Syndrome. Most patients were subjected to exploitation, which
                is suspected to be the cause of the disease. Scientists discovered Emoteria in those who retained
                their color vision and extracted it from their brains for further research and medical study.
                Recently, they confirmed that Emoteria reside at the core of the human brain and randomly appears
                in other parts of it. Several characteristics are identified. However, Emoteria can only be seen
                when the host consciously awakens them, which makes deeper research more challenging.
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Healthy Emoteria should
                remain fully under the host's control. The host can choose to ignore it or focus on it at will. However,
                long time of neglect may lead to mutation. To maintain its stability, please provide it with a proper
                amount of attention each day. The flower serves as a signal of its health.
