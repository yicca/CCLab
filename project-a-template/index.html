                The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living
                terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as
                one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing
                them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as
                well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil
                record. (This is from Wikipedia, write the story, history, facts, tales, myths, anecdotes about your
                creature.)
                The Monochrome Age began 30 years ago, when more than 80% of humans suddenly lost the ability to
                perceive
                color due to Monochrome Syndrome. Scholars discovered Emoteria in those who retained their color vision
                and extracted it from their brains for further research and medical study. Recently, they confirmed that
                Emoteria are a type of neural cell located at the core of the human brain and identified several of its
                key characteristics. However, the official method of nurturing it remains unknown.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Healthy Emoteria should
                remain fully under the host's control. The host can choose to ignore it or focus on it at will. However,
                long time of neglect may lead to mutation. To maintain its stability, please provide it with a proper
                amount of attention each day. The flower serves as a signal of its health.
